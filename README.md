# Kim Schneider - @ikasch

Hey i'm Kim - a frontend engineer living in hamburg. I'm interested in future mobility stuff and work for [@MOIA](http://moia.io) and [@Emmy](https://emmy-sharing.de).

Besides coding i'm interested in playingcards, longboarding, bikes and what my next tattoo should be.

## How i work

I specialised in motion and animation design for the web.

Right now i am working a lot with React.

I try to share my knowledge as much as i can and learn every day right after what [@AlieWard](https://twitter.com/AlieWard) said "Ask smart people stupid questions".
